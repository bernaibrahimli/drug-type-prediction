# Patient Drug Type Prediction - Decision Trees - Machine Learning Algorithms
Exploring ML algorithms using the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Using decision tree algorithm for predicting which drug might be appropriate for a future patient based on data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness and 1 out of 5 drugs they responded during their treatment
